              Tokenomics refers to the economic model of a cryptocurrency or
              token and its distribution. The specifics of tokenomics can vary
              depending on the project, but here are some common components and
              allocation percentages: Token supply: The total number of tokens
              that will be created. This can vary depending on the project, but
              is usually predetermined and fixed. Initial distribution: The
              allocation of tokens when the project launches. This can be done
              through an initial coin offering (ICO), airdrops, or other
              methods.

                  Community: 40-50%. This percentage is usually set aside for
                  the community that will use the token. This can include
                  incentives for early adopters, rewards for participation in
                  the network, or other community-building initiatives.

                  Team: 20-25%. This percentage is usually set aside for the
                  founders and developers of the project. The teamâ€™s tokens are
                  often vested over a period of time to ensure they have a

                  angel investors.
